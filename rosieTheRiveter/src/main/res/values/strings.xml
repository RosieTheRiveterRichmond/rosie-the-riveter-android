        It is located on the site of Kaiser Shipyard #2 where many women worked alongside men to build Liberty and Victory Ships. The 
        monument represents the bow, stern and steam stack of a Liberty ship. \n\nThe walkway to the bay is the same length as the keel 
        of a Liberty ship (441 feet). The walk is a timeline that tells the story of the national home front during World War 2. As you follow the timeline you can imagine the Liberty ships under construction, lined up side-by-side, 
        roughly where the monument stands today. Be sure to view your position in the Kaiser shipyards on the
        &quot;SHIPYARDS&quot; tab of this app.\n\nThe monument was designed  by Cheryl Barton and Susan Schwartzenberg and was dedicated on October 14, 2000.</string>

    <string name="red_oak_text">The <i>SS Red Oak Victory</i> is the only ship built in the Kaiser shipyards that is being restored. It 
    	is a Victory class cargo ship that was launched November 9, 1944. She was transferred from the Merchant Marines to the US Navy 
    	December 5, 1944 and converted at Port Chicago to carry munitions.\n\nThe <i>Red Oak Victory</i> operated in the Marshall and 
    	Caroline Islands and the Philippines, distributing munitions to ships in the Pacific Fleet. She was decommissioned in 1946 and 
    	subsequently served as a cargo ship until 1968. Mothballed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay, she was saved from 
    	the scrapyard by the Richmond Museum Association in 1993. Since then a dedicated group of volunteers has worked diligently to restore 
    	the ship.\n\nAs a munitions ship the <i>Red Oak Victory</i> was essentially a floating bomb, carrying up to 4,000 tons of munitions. This was 
    	extremely hazardous duty for the crewmen. An explosion due to accident or enemy action would instantly kill all on board. Nevertheless, 
    	the <i>Red Oak Victory</i> did not suffer a single casualty during her tour of duty.\n\nVictory Ships were designed as an improvement 
    	over the Liberty Ship. At 455 feet  long and 62 feet wide they were 14 foot longer and 5 foot wider. To escape enemy submarine action their 
    	top speed was 17 knots, 4 to 6 knots faster than a Liberty Ship. The first Victory Ship was launched in February 1944 and by the war\'s end 
    	531 had been built - 142 of them here in Richmond.</string>

    <string name="kaiser_hospital_text">Opened August 10, 1942, the Kaiser Richmond Field Hospital was built to serve the employees of 
        the Kaiser shipyards. It was financed by the U.S. Maritime Commission and sponsored by Henry Kaiser\'s Permanente Foundation. 
        It was the second tier of a three tier medical care system.  (First tier was on-site first aid stations; third tier the primary 
        hospital in Oakland.) Initially built as a 10 bed facility, it was expanded to 160 beds by 1944.\n\nIndustrial accidents were a 
        significant problem in World War 2, in fact up until D-Day more Americans were killed in home front industrial accidents than on 
        the battlefield.\n\nHenry Kaiser\'s solution to this problem was to offer a pre-paid health plan to his workers, one of the first 
        voluntary pre-paid health plans in the country. By August 1944 92.2 percent of the shipyard workers had joined the plan. After the 
        war the plan was expanded to cover employee families.\n\nThis innovative approach was a precursor to health maintanance organizations 
        (HMOs) was the beginning of Kaiser Permanente, now the largest non-profit HMO in the country.\n\nAfter the war, the hospital remained as 
        part of Kaiser Permanente until replaced by a new Richmond facility in 1996.</string>

    <string name="atchison4_caption">Map outlining the boundaries of Atchison Village</string>
    <string name="atchison_text">Atchison Village was built in 1941 to house Kaiser Shipyard workers. It was funded by the Lanham Community 
        Facilities Act. The Lanham Act provided $150 million to construct housing for defense workers. This funded construction of approximately 
        625,000 units throughout the country. Of the 20 World War 2 housing projects built in Richmond only Atchison Village, Nystrom Village and Triangle Court
        remain.\n\nAtchison Village contains 97 one story buildings and 65 two story buildings, providing a total of 450 apartments.\n\n
        In 1956 the government sold Atchison Village to its inhabitants for $1.5 million. Today it remains a housing cooperative.\n\nThere was 
        tremenous demand for new housing during the war. When World War 2 began the population of Richmond was 23,600. By 1943 it had increased to 
        over 93,700. Housing was in such short supply that many Kaiser Shipyard employees "hot bunked" - at night the bed was used by a day shift 
        worker, in the day by a night shift worker. In addition thousands commuted from elsewhere in the bay, so many that a railroad was built 
        from Emeryville to Richmond to carry shipyard workers.</string>

    <string name="ford_plant_text">While the Kaiser Shipyards were the largest defense facilities in Richmond, there were others. The Ford 
        Richmond Assembly Plant is an important example. Civilian automobile manufacturing was halted during World War 2 and the automobile 
        plants were converted to support the war effort. Serving as the Richmond Tank Depot (one of three tank depots in the country) the Ford Plant 
        supported the Pacific Theater. 49,225 jeeps were built here. In addition it performed final assembly on  tanks, half-tracked armored 
        personnel carriers and other military vehicles after their initial construction elsewhere. In this role it  processed over 91,000 vehicles.\n\nThe plant has 
        a history before and after the war in the construction of civilian automobiles. It was built in 1930 in the midst of the depression. The 
        architect was Albert Kahn, noted for his industrial designs. His innovative use reinforced concrete enabled construction of factories 
        with large open spaces lit by the significant use of windows. These stylistic hallmarks are visible in this building. Kahn designed the 
        massive Ford Highland Park auto works built in 1917 to produce the Model T, the plant where Henry Ford perfected the assembly line. Kahn went on 
        to design numerous auto plants as well as other important buildings.\n\nFollowing the war, the Richmond plant returned to the construction of 
        automobiles. The last car was constructed here in 1953.\n\nThe building was seriously damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. 
        The City of Richmond took on the repair of the building, a project that was completed in 2008. It now houses light industry and a 
        restaurant. The large Craneway Pavilion, with its wall of windows facing the bay, is rented for special events.\n\n

    <string name="child_center_text">The Maritime Child Center was built in 1943 to provide child care for the employees of the Kaiser 
        Shipyards. It was funded by the U.S. Maritime Commission at the request of Henry Kaiser. While commonplace today, the working 
        mother was uncommon prior to World War 2. Day care was an innovative concept. Under Kaiser\'s direction about 35 day care centers 
        were constructed in Richmond for the children of the shipyard workers. Kaiser hired child development experts from UC Berkeley and 
        elsewhere to assist in the creation of education and child care programs. Catherine Landreth from UC Berkeley oversaw the enterprise. 
        The day care centers had outdoor space for fresh air and exercise and art and music were included as part of their curriculum. The children received 
        warm meals, medical attention and had beds available. Warm meals could be purchased and taken home for the children and their families. 
        The centers were open 24 hours and the employees could drop the children off when they worked night shifts.\n\nThis center and the Ruth Powers 
        Child Development Center on Cutting Boulevard are the only World War 2 facilities remaining. After recent rehabilitation, they continue 
        to serve the purpose for which they were built.</string>

    <string name="shipyard3_text">Kaiser Shipyard #3 is the best preserved of the four Richmond shipyards. It is also the only one of the four intended to be a permanent 
        shipyard. Today you can still view five World War 2 era buildings: the massive concrete General Warehouse, Riggers Loft, the machine shop, the first aid station and the cafeteria. 
        The General Warehouse was used to store the many items - from furniture to blankets and brooms - required to fit out a ship. Riggers Loft, completed in 1942 was used to assemble 
        prefabricated ship parts. Its 25000 square foot open space interior has 25 foot ceilings. 
        There is a World War 2 Whirley Crane, so-called for their ability to 
        turn 360 degrees. Behind the General Warehouse there are five graving/dry docks used for the construction of the ships. These are not currently viewable. 
        Shipyard #3 is also home to the SS Red Oak Victory.\n\nCargo ships were crucial for winning the war, providing a lifeline to the United Kingdom as well as supplying 
        United States military operations. During World War 2 the four Richmond 
        shipyards produced 747 ships, primarily Liberty and Victory class cargo ships. Henry Kaiser developed mass production techniques that enabled his shipyards to produce ships at two-thirds 
        the time and a quarter the cost of other shipyards. To accomplish this he introduced innovations drawn from automobile assembly lines 
        and his own experience on dam building projects. He used modular, pre-fabricated construction. Large pre-made 
        parts were moved into place by the Whirley Cranes and then welded together by "Wendy the Welder" and her male counterparts. Welding - as opposed to riveting - 
        simplified the operation and reduced training time. As on assembly lines, workers were typically trained in a single skill. Unskilled workers 
        could be assigned to perform simple repetative tasks. By 1944 the shipyards routinely built ships in two week\'s time and on one occasion 
        built the Liberty ship SS Robert E. Peary in 5 days in a shipyard competition.\n\nThe Richmond shipyards workforce reached 30,000 within one 
        month of the Pearl Harbor attack. At their peak they employed about 90,000, 27% of whom were women.</string>

    <string name="port_chicago_text">Port Chicago was a supply depot used to load munitions on ships to supply the Pacific Theater. 
        The first ship was loaded December 8, 1942. The enlisted men unloaded munitions brought in by train and loaded the ships by
        hand, winch and crane. Munitions processed here included high explosive bombs, shells and torpedoes.\n\n
        The enlisted men loading the ships were entirely African American. The officers were entirely white. The loaders were poorly
        trained and the officers inexperienced in managing munitions handling. There was significant tension as the loaders felt
        they were pressed into unsafe procedures to improve the speed of the operation.\n\nOn December 17, 1944 disaster struck. The 
        Liberty ship SS E.A. Bryan was being loaded with high explosives at Pier 1. Alongside the Victory ship SS Quinault Victory was
        being prepared for loading. The munitions loaded on the ship and that on the pier totaled the equivalent of about 2,000 tons of 
        TNT. There was an explosion and fire on the pier followed by a huge explosion as the munitions on the ship and pier detonated.\n\n
        The 320 military personnel on the pier died instantly. An additional 390 civilians and military personnel were injured. The E.A. Bryan was
        immediately destroyed and the Quinault was torn into pieces. Pilots flying overhead reported debris tossed 12,000 feet in the air. 
        The explosion was heard throughout the East Bay and rattled windows as far south as 
        Fremont, 45 miles away. Seismographs at UC Berkeley measured the shock waves as the equivalent of a 3.4 earthquake.\n\nThis was by far the worst disaster of the World War 2 home front. The exact cause of the explosion was never determined.\n\nFollowing the Port Chicago disaster, surviving personnel were
        assigned to Mare Island Navel Base, reinforced with new recruits, and again assigned to load munitions. 258 refused citing continued
        dangerous practices. 208 were court-martialed for disobeying orders and given bad conduct discharges. 50 were court-martialed for
        mutiny and sentenced to 8 to 15 years hard labor. They are known today as the Port Chicago 50. They were granted clemency in 1946
        but legal and political struggles that surrounded them continue to this day.\n\nIn many minds the story of the Port Chicago disaster 
        and the Port Chicago 50 came to represent the unfairness of a segregated military. In 1945, partially in response to these events,
        the Navy began moving toward full desegregation, which became manditory by presidential decree in 1948. The disaster and its
        aftermath was a pivotal point in the African American struggle for equal rights.

    <string name="firehouse67a_text">Firehouse 67a was built in 1943. It was designed to house three trucks with men sleeping upstairs. 1943 
        also saw the completion of a new 8 man fire house at 41st and Clinton and the expansion of the fire house at 31st and Cutting.\n\n
        Enhancing community fire protection was of critical importance. The new shipyards needed protection from fire due to accident, sabotage 
        and, potentially, enemy attack. Thousands of new housing units were being built in Richmond - these needed protection as well.\n\n
        The explosive growth of the Kaiser shipyards and Richmond itself placed great demands on the supporting infrastructure. Roads, public 
        transit, schools, police and fire protection struggled to meet the expanded demands. The effort was made more challanging by the 
        wartime restrictions on materials and workforce. Even shops and movie houses were overwhelmed by the new demand, often staying open 
        24 hours a day.
